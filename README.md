# COVID-19RESOURCESTWITTER

This is my submission for the #hackathon organised by Pepcoding Education Private Limited...
As we all know, in these critical times, it is very difficult to find verified covid resources leads.
But on twitter the tweets come in handy and provides the latest covid resources leads.
I have created an automation script that scraped the data of #covidresources from Twitter and displays the data on the terminal.
It uses the latest hashtags to scrape the data ans shows toh top 10 latest tweets
I plan to store the data along with the url in the form of pdf for the next steps in the project.
